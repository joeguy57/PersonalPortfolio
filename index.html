      </p>

      <div class="about-me__body">
        <p>
          I am a recent graduate of the University of Alberta with a Bachelor's
          degree in Computing Science. I have a strong background in software
          development and programming and experience in IT support, inventory
          management, and data optimization. My most recent role was as a System
          Flow Project Coordinator for the Saskatchewan Health Authorities where
          I coordinated and managed project timelines, provided training and
          support to staff, and used data analysis and optimization techniques
          to improve system efficiency. I have strong public speaking and
          communication skills, as well as time management, problem-solving, and
          team collaboration skills.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my previous role as an International Student Representative for the
          Augustana Student Association, I coordinated with various clubs and
          groups to accommodate the needs of international students and improve
          their satisfaction on campus. I have also interned as an Information
          Technology Intern for Al Jaber Engineering where I maintained servers
          and workstations and provided technical support to employees.
        </p>
        <p>
          My technical skills include proficiency in programming languages such
          as Python, Java, and JavaScript for android development and web
          design. I am also experienced in web development technologies such as
          HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as using Git and GitHub for version
          control and code management. I have knowledge of databases such as
          MySQL and Firebase, and experience in data visualization and analysis
          using Power BI. I am also proficient in Microsoft Office and Google
          Suite.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to my professional experience, I have also had the
          opportunity to volunteer as a web and software developer for Academics
          Without Borders where I provided open-source textbooks for a
          university in Eswatini. I also served as the Vice-President of Inside
          the Club, where I coordinated software development workshops and
          events with other clubs.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have received several awards and certifications, including the Mark
          Chytracek Leadership award, completion of five courses in Google IT
          Support, a valid WHIMS training certificate, the Onesimus Award, and
          the FURCA Outstanding Communication – Demonstration award.

          experience in action. There, you will find examples of my technical
