<a name="l12"><span class="ln">12   </span></a>
<a name="l13"><span class="ln">13   </span></a>  <span class="s0">The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed</span>
<a name="l14"><span class="ln">14   </span></a><span class="s0">to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,</span>
<a name="l15"><span class="ln">15   </span></a><span class="s0">the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to</span>
<a name="l16"><span class="ln">16   </span></a><span class="s0">share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free</span>
<a name="l17"><span class="ln">17   </span></a><span class="s0">software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the</span>
<a name="l18"><span class="ln">18   </span></a><span class="s0">GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to</span>
<a name="l19"><span class="ln">19   </span></a><span class="s0">any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to</span>
<a name="l20"><span class="ln">20   </span></a><span class="s0">your programs, too.</span>
<a name="l21"><span class="ln">21   </span></a>
<a name="l22"><span class="ln">22   </span></a>  <span class="s0">When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not</span>
<a name="l23"><span class="ln">23   </span></a><span class="s0">price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you</span>
<a name="l24"><span class="ln">24   </span></a><span class="s0">have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for</span>
<a name="l25"><span class="ln">25   </span></a><span class="s0">them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you</span>
<a name="l26"><span class="ln">26   </span></a><span class="s0">want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new</span>
<a name="l27"><span class="ln">27   </span></a><span class="s0">free programs, and that you know you can do these things.</span>
<a name="l28"><span class="ln">28   </span></a>
<a name="l29"><span class="ln">29   </span></a>  <span class="s0">To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you</span>
<a name="l30"><span class="ln">30   </span></a><span class="s0">these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have</span>
<a name="l31"><span class="ln">31   </span></a><span class="s0">certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if</span>
<a name="l32"><span class="ln">32   </span></a><span class="s0">you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.</span>
<a name="l33"><span class="ln">33   </span></a>
<a name="l34"><span class="ln">34   </span></a>  <span class="s0">For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether</span>
<a name="l35"><span class="ln">35   </span></a><span class="s0">gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same</span>
<a name="l36"><span class="ln">36   </span></a><span class="s0">freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive</span>
<a name="l37"><span class="ln">37   </span></a><span class="s0">or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they</span>
<a name="l38"><span class="ln">38   </span></a><span class="s0">know their rights.</span>
<a name="l39"><span class="ln">39   </span></a>
<a name="l40"><span class="ln">40   </span></a>  <span class="s0">Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:</span>
<a name="l41"><span class="ln">41   </span></a><span class="s0">(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License</span>
<a name="l42"><span class="ln">42   </span></a><span class="s0">giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.</span>
<a name="l43"><span class="ln">43   </span></a>
<a name="l44"><span class="ln">44   </span></a>  <span class="s0">For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains</span>
<a name="l45"><span class="ln">45   </span></a><span class="s0">that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and</span>
<a name="l46"><span class="ln">46   </span></a><span class="s0">authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as</span>
<a name="l47"><span class="ln">47   </span></a><span class="s0">changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to</span>
<a name="l48"><span class="ln">48   </span></a><span class="s0">authors of previous versions.</span>
<a name="l49"><span class="ln">49   </span></a>
<a name="l50"><span class="ln">50   </span></a>  <span class="s0">Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run</span>
<a name="l51"><span class="ln">51   </span></a><span class="s0">modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer</span>
<a name="l52"><span class="ln">52   </span></a><span class="s0">can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of</span>
<a name="l53"><span class="ln">53   </span></a><span class="s0">protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic</span>
<a name="l54"><span class="ln">54   </span></a><span class="s0">pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to</span>
<a name="l55"><span class="ln">55   </span></a><span class="s0">use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we</span>
<a name="l56"><span class="ln">56   </span></a><span class="s0">have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those</span>
<a name="l57"><span class="ln">57   </span></a><span class="s0">products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we</span>
<a name="l58"><span class="ln">58   </span></a><span class="s0">stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions</span>
<a name="l59"><span class="ln">59   </span></a><span class="s0">of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.</span>
<a name="l60"><span class="ln">60   </span></a>
<a name="l61"><span class="ln">61   </span></a>  <span class="s0">Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.</span>
<a name="l62"><span class="ln">62   </span></a><span class="s0">States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of</span>
<a name="l63"><span class="ln">63   </span></a><span class="s0">software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to</span>
<a name="l64"><span class="ln">64   </span></a><span class="s0">avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could</span>
<a name="l65"><span class="ln">65   </span></a><span class="s0">make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that</span>
<a name="l66"><span class="ln">66   </span></a><span class="s0">patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.</span>
<a name="l67"><span class="ln">67   </span></a>
